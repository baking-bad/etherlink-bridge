(*
    `settle-withdrawal` is the fast withdrawal interface used for processing
    XTZ-native tickets from the Etherlink rollup during fast withdrawals:

    - ticket: the provided XTZ-native ticket to be burned,
    - timestamp: the time when withdrawal was applied on the Etherlink side,
    - base_withdrawer: the target receiver of the fast withdrawal,
    - payload: additional data containing the fast withdrawal conditions,
    - l2_caller: the original sender address on the Etherlink side.
