        TokenBridgeHelper is a helper contract which helps user to communicate with
        Etherlink Bridge components that requires tickets to be packed into
        external data structure.

        This contract expected to be temporal solution until Tezos will support
        ability to transfer tickets within additional data structure from
        implicit accounts.
