(*
    `rollup-deposit` is an interface for the Ehterlink smart rollup.
    As far as smart rollups currently do not support entrypoints (like
    smart contracts), to access the `deposit` entrypoint, it needs to be
    constructed from the full contract type:
    - routing_info: routing information for the deposit (20 or 40 bytes
        representing a receiver and an ERC20 token address concatinated)
    - ticket: a ticket to be deposited

    ticket: Ticket.t;
